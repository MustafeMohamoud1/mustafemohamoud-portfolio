# mustafemohamoud-portfolio
This weeks challenge was for us to create a portfolio for our User which this week was a Potential Employer. Our web application had to meet the following Acceptance criteria :

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

WHEN I load their portfolio,
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application,
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

WHEN I click on the images of the applications,
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.


My basic mock-up portfolio meets all the acceptance criteria as well as all the other additional application requirements. Below is a screenshot of my deployed website as well as a link to it:
